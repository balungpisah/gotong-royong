# UI Feature Inventory (Research Phase 0)

Use this file as the master list of UI features to be mapped to backend behavior.

## How to use

- One row per UI feature or flow.
- `Trigger` identifies exactly when backend logic should start.
- Rows are ordered by user journey.

## Research status meaning

- `TODO`: feature identified; contracts/triggers/data model still need formal backend mapping.
- `Mapped`: contract source + trigger + payload confirmed.
