# Gotong Royong Design Documentation

This directory holds the design-facing documentation and prototypes.

- [design/context](./context): Source-of-truth terms, decisions, sequence, track map, and review notes
- [design/specs](./specs): Formal design/system specifications (modularized by feature area)
- [design/specs/README.md](./specs/README.md): Specs module map and folder structure
- [design/prototypes](./prototypes): Browser-viewable HTML references
- [design/archive](./archive): Superseded historical artifacts (legacy Word drafts)
- [DESIGN-INDEX.md](../DESIGN-INDEX.md): Canonical cross-linking map across design artifacts

All design references should use the paths under `/docs/design/...`; no root-level compatibility stubs are used anymore.
