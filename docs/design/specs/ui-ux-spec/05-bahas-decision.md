## 4. Discussion Phase Pattern

> **Updated 2026-02-16.** "Bahas" is no longer a fixed stage. Discussion is a common phase pattern that the LLM may include in any adaptive path when deliberation is needed.

When a plan includes a discussion-oriented phase, the following diagnostic questions guide the LLM in proposing subsequent phases and checkpoints:

| Diagnostic Question | If Yes | LLM Action |
|---|---|---|
| Perlu rencana detail? | Complex case | Propose planning phase with task breakdown |
| Perlu dana/sumber daya? | Resources needed | Propose Galang checkpoint or phase |
| Perlu dukungan publik? | Advocacy needed | Propose outreach checkpoints (Siarkan pattern) |
| Perlu eskalasi ke otoritas? | Authority escalation | Flag in current phase checkpoints |
| PIC siapa? | Always required | Include PIC assignment as checkpoint |

### 4.1 PIC (Penanggung Jawab)

Every plan should have a PIC assigned early in the path. PIC is accountable for momentum, not a ruler. PIC can be transferred via governed handoff. When Galang activates: Bendahara role. When Siarkan activates: Humas role. PIC does not have unilateral power — checkpoint transitions may require vote.

### 4.2 Consent Window (Anti-Stall)

Low-risk checkpoint transitions auto-advance after a configured duration unless someone objects. Stop button: any participant can object, which pauses auto-advance and triggers a standard vote.
