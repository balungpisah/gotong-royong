## 4. Bahas: The Decision Point

Bahas (discuss) is the most important stage. Structured diagnostic:

| Diagnostic Question | If Yes | Stage Activated |
|---|---|---|
| Perlu rencana detail? | Complex project | Rancang |
| Perlu dana/sumber daya? | Fundraising needed | Galang |
| Perlu dukungan publik? | Advocacy needed | Siarkan |
| Perlu eskalasi ke otoritas? | Authority escalation | Flag on Garap |
| PIC siapa? | Always required | PIC assignment |

### 4.1 PIC (Penanggung Jawab)

Every entity must have a PIC assigned at Bahas. PIC is not a ruler — they're accountable for momentum. Assigned at Bahas, can be transferred via governed handoff. When Galang activates: Bendahara role. When Siarkan activates: Humas role. PIC does not have unilateral power — transitions require vote.

### 4.2 Consent Window (Anti-Stall)

Low-risk transitions auto-advance after X hours unless someone objects. Stop button: any participant can object, which pauses auto-advance and triggers standard vote.
