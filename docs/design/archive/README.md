## Fixed-Track Era Documents (Superseded by Adaptive Path Model)

The following files described a rigid five-track lifecycle (Tuntaskan, Wujudkan, Telusuri, Rayakan, Musyawarah) with fixed Bahas→Rancang→Garap→Periksa stage sequences. This model has been superseded by the **Adaptive Path model** — see [`docs/design/context/ADAPTIVE-PATH-MAP.md`](../context/ADAPTIVE-PATH-MAP.md).

| File | Reason Archived |
|------|----------------|
| [TRACK-MAP.md](./TRACK-MAP.md) | Described fixed-track lifecycle; superseded by `ADAPTIVE-PATH-MAP.md` |
| [DESIGN-SEQUENCE.md](./DESIGN-SEQUENCE.md) | Described fixed Bahas→Rancang→Garap→Periksa sequence as lifecycle driver |
| [04-stages-per-track.md](./04-stages-per-track.md) | Per-track fixed stage sequences; superseded by `04-adaptive-phase-patterns.md` |

## Pre-Batch-2 UI/UX Spec Snapshot (`ui-ux-spec-v0.5/`)

The `ui-ux-spec-v0.5/` subdirectory contains a snapshot of the original v0.5 spec files before the Adaptive Path batch rewrites. Current (post-rewrite) versions live in `docs/design/specs/ui-ux-spec/`.
