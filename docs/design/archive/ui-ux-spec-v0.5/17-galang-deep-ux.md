## 16. Galang Deep UX (Cross-Cutting Feature)

> **Updated 2026-02-16.** Galang is a cross-cutting resource-pooling feature, not tied to any specific track. It can be activated as a phase or checkpoint within any adaptive path when resource collection is needed.

Phase 1: Manual tracking. Phase 2: E-wallet integration (GoPay, OVO, Dana, ShopeePay). Phase 3: In-app wallet. Ledger: date, contributor, amount, method, status. Running total vs target. Audit trail: append-only. Refund: within 14d if cancelled. Misuse: flag → freeze → Jury.

Galang is proposed by the LLM when the case requires resource pooling, or manually requested by a privileged editor. The 6 financial fields are always protected (🔒). Bendahara role is assigned when Galang is active.
