## 1. Design Pillars

**Feed-First.** The home screen is a living feed of community activity. Each entity is a card that changes face based on its current stage. Users scroll to see what's happening, tap to go deeper. The feed is the heartbeat of the community.

**Living Card.** Every witness is a card that evolves. Same identity, different face at each stage. A Seed-stage card looks like a social media post. An Execute-stage card looks like a task board. An Impact-stage card looks like a celebration. The shape tells the story.

**Phase-Specific Detail.** Tapping a card opens a purpose-built detail page for that phase. Not one morphing page — each phase has its own page with its own job. A discussion phase page is a forum. An execution phase page is a task board. A verification phase page is a review panel. Different rooms in the same house.

**Subtle Signals.** Reputation is ambient. Trust shows through visual cues — tier badges, avatar warmth, weight in governance — not through leaderboards or point counters. Trust is the texture of the interface.

**Witness Narrative.** Every witness is a story with chapters. The engagement loop is narrative progression: "did my report lead to a real solution?" Users come back because they're invested in outcomes, not chasing likes.

**Smart Urgency.** Notifications respect attention by default (daily digest) but escalate to real-time when it matters (challenge windows closing, tasks stalling). The system earns the right to interrupt.
