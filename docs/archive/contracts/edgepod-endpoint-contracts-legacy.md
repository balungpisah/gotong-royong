# Archived: Edge-Pod Endpoint Contracts (Legacy)

Archived on: 2026-02-26
Original path: `docs/research/contracts/edgepod-endpoint-contracts.md`

Reason:
- Matrix remains useful as historical research, but it is not aligned with the runtime `triage.v1` contract used by frontend/backend today.

Use this canonical source instead:
- `docs/research/contracts/triage-witness-feed-contract-v1.md`
